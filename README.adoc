## Running the App locally
A https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot[Spring Boot] application built using Maven to Send/Consume RabbitMQ messages. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/bpabdelkader/rabbitmq-client.git
cd rabbitmq-client
mvn clean package
java -jar target/rabbitmq-client-2.0.0.jar
```
A distribution Jar is as well attached in dist directory.

You can then access UI here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Configuration
Queue configuration(Concurrency/Batch mode/Acknowledge Mode) is stored in application.yml:
```yml

  rabbitmq:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: "5672"
    username: guest
    password: guest
    consumer:

        batch-size: 40
        acknowledge-mode: AUTO # NONE, MANUAL, AUTO
